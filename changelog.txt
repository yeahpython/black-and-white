v3: 30 Jan
-Started a change log
-Started moving collision / side management functions out of the player class
-Appearance edits?

v4: 30 Jan
-side management now under collision
-Split up the "removing interior" and "merging adjacent" steps of combining sides, since it's more effective to do ALL the interior removal first.
-Set up something to try to simplify all the edges at the start, but it has no physical impact at the moment.

v5: 31 Jan
Moved the "project" function out of the player class and dumped it in the collision file.

v6: 31 Jan
Removed the glitch where the side-simplification pattern wasn't working. Turns out it was because I was feeding it negative columns and weird stuff via the get_sides function.

v7: 1 Feb
Trying to deal with corners collision problem.
player can only slide out of left corner here… wonder why?
#   #
 ###
procrastinating from finding a genuine fix…
Quick edit on normals saved with tiles to make them all of length 1.
Going to precompute all the combined sides first.

v8: 1 Feb
Added the find_all_tiles, find_enough_tiles, and find_tiles_rect functions.

v9: 2 Feb
Restructured game so that sides are pre-merged.
Big idea: pre-calculate whether or not each side grounds objects.

v9B: 3 Feb
After v10 went to hell:
moving project back to player class.
introducing test module.
make sure each side knows its number

v9C: 3 Feb
Removed Diagnostics crap.

v9D: 3 Feb
removed num_deflections from grounded check since unnecessary.
similarly removed screen check from side.is_hit_by
first precalculate grounded
removed the feeding mechanism entirely.

v9E: 3 Feb
so we do need the screen check in side.is_hit_by.
generally made code prettier / more efficient.
Move project into "Physical" superclass of Player.
Everything is kind of efficient and pretty
Time to combine normal and grounded as one variable: A list of normal vectors. Okay maybe not quite.

v9F: 3 Feb
Gonna make the grounded and normal stuff prettier.

v11: 4 Feb
removed the recursion from the project function.
ignoring corners for now:
Collision problems have something to do with int vs. float.
Experimenting with modified projection methods.
oh hell
find the matrix such that after transformation the two segments are parallel to the axes, then segment intersection should be good and trivial. 

v12: 5 Feb

v14: 5 feb
Making velocity modifications a part of is_hit_by
side collision is solid with introduction of stickiness; some corner collision done.
Made a Bee Class that currently duplicates the Player class.

v15: 5 Feb
Gave Bee a brain and fun inputs to process

In future:
Write collision code to deal with corners
Optimize that side-combining function by grouping them by normal and position with respect to that normal.
Make player-bee interaction more interesting.
Make variables more easily accessible

v27ish 10 Feb
bees have brains and eyes. Made the activation function work and simplified outputs; Optimized side-combining function but still lacking
Bees hit player.

v28 10 Feb
made the world wrap

latest
made food
made stationary property
made physics lazy
-when stationary on a flat plane, stop doing physics
-when outside screen - freeze all people
made responsetime variable to cut down on drawing the opponents

to do:
make creatures saveable.
make brains lazy
-when outside screen - turn off computing
bug fixes for collision testing accross tile map boundaries

make rendering lazy (definitely not a major consideration.)
-just make a start to it: Only draw to necessary portions of world and necessary parts of screen
-make it easier to change tile sizes

===================
LONG PERIOD OF DGAF
===================

Now have neural network visualization 
And interactive character sprite thing
Also random map generation

Sunday 29 Dec

- add special stasis mode and bee selection

- cancel for tweak variables

- make a room collision layer

- add options to change settings

	- make a list of settings and access them by index

- make a utils file for stuff like
	- finding all the extra locations a shape needs to be drawn

- allow deleting bees
	- confirm deletions

- add cancel to save bee

- don’t allow overwriting bees

- make map preview not derpy

Monday 30 Dec

- make flash self.color

- dynamically choose colors

- save eye locations

- try to get mouse input

- clean up borders

- use click outside to exit from pause

- made a start to saving levels

Tuesday 31 Dec

- worked out how to pause properly (do clock tick but set dt = 0)
- made circles match starting color for visualize_intelligence
- add an eye mutation rate
- when you load a saved came the player doesn't get pushed? Fix glitch
- eyes mutating too fast
- fix view shortcuts
- fixed silly integer-valued disps
- error checking for settings
- added setting for sensitivity to player
- make it so that there are explicitly random maps
- make eyes prettier
- weird huge bee glitch
- make getChoiceUnbounded snap to mouse from the first frame

Jan 1st
- bound the body distortion
- make getChoiceUnbounded actually unbounded
- made topbar more useable
- made tons of stuff more modifyable
- smoothed over infinity glitch in palette
- made a GLOBABL VARIABLE FOR time_to_quit :D
- allow quitting from the place where you modify settings
- make lots of settings clicky. But now they shuffle
- stop settings from shuffling around so much
- non-horrible quitting

============
Todo / Notes
============

- random maps breaking saves

- fix quitting for neural network visualization mode

- clean up string edit (dirtiness from label
(maybe generate text from enter string)

- cancel from string edit

- test settings

- make it possible to load physical modes

- hypothesis: madness variable causing crashes?

- make jump time changeable? Don't think anyone cares

- level editor

- fix neural network visualization, esp. titles

- glitch where if you run for a while you can't save

- close while loading map?

- make quitting work properly

- make save more resilient?

- make load more resilient?

- make a proper key down tool

- cache the physics information about a map each time a new map is saved
- make levels save information like name and randomize
- automatically find levels?

VISUALIZING NODES:
- how to evaluate quality of plot
	- similarity of two nodes in same player - > should be closer
	- strong connection - > should be closer
	- otherwise -> should be farther
- make a hat that faces the tracker?
- change node colors / sizes by value
- watch a node change live
- automatically remove torque?

load bees
- dummy in place

- options to save settings

- live modification of existing map

- bee selection

- bee interaction:
	- peer-pressure forces / wind
	- repulsion forces

- better way of organizing computephysics

- do something smarter than randomness during tile adjustment in random map generation

- change graphics to make stuff look less rigid

- make Q as a quit button ubiquitous

- make a cleaner interface for generally displaying images

- only draw bees if they’re in the display

- change the way eyes work:
	- have fixed pixel offsets and check them.

- change the way collision works:
	- draw a triangle with the feet and head and collide it

- more procedurally generated stuff

- design a better GUI
	- make a GUI class with its own update and draw functions
	- make it clickable?
